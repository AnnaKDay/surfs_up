# surfs_up
weather analysis for Hawaii using Python, Jupyter, and SQLite

## Overview
This analysis was conducted to see temperature trends in the middle of summer compared to tempatured trends in the middle of winter for the island of Oahu. This is to determine year-round sustainability for the surf and ice-cream shop business W.Avy is considering investing in.

## Results
### June

- The average temperature in June is around 75 degrees Farenheit
- The minimum temperature has been recorded at 64 degrees Farenheit
- The maximum temperature has been recorded at 85 degrees Farenheit
- Using standard deviation, we can estimate that most days will be between 72 and 78 degrees Farenheit in June

### December

- The average temperature in June is around 71 degrees Farenheit
- The minimum has been recorded at 56 degrees Farenheit
- The maximum has been recorded at 83 degrees Farenheit
- We can expect most days will be between 68 and 74 degrees Farenheit

## Summary
According to surf-forecast.com (https://www.surf-forecast.com/breaks/Perfect-Wave/seatemp), the numbers for both June and December temperatures fall within acceptable ranges for surfing. Taking into account that wetsuits can also be worn (and likely will be worn by dedicated surfers) to balance external conditions, Oahu has a good outlook for year-round sustainability for a surf and ice-cream shop. 
- In terms of additional queries, it would also be a good idea to get summary statistics on precipitation
- Another important query that would benefit the analysis would be on wind-speed/windiness, since this highly affects surfing conditions and safety
